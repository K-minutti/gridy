# What is computation?

Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python: With Application to Understanding Data Second Edition
Chapters 1 and 2.1

Chapter 1

If a program has not syntatic errors and no static semantic errors then it has semantics or mearning. In other words it can do something as it a legal set instructions a computer can execute this does not mean that it will produce the expected result - the program can easily be wrong.

FE: Write an algorithm for driving between two desitnations for a person
Walk to car -> Unlock and Open car door
Get in car -> Sit down in drivers seat
Fasten seatbelt and check mirrors, etc. -> If push push to start else insert key and turn to start (assuming car is automatic)
If you know the directions from memory check surroundings and start driving out of current station onto road else
Search up directions to second desitnation on google maps then check surroundings and start driving out of current station onto road
While following GPS instructions
Pay attention to road and GPS
Don't forget to breathe

Chapter 2
Interpreted versus compiled languages. The difference between interpereted versus compiled languages is that the instructions written the programmer also known as the source code is executed directly by an interpreter for interpreted languages where as for compiled the code is first converted (by a compiler) into a sequence of machine-level primitive operations.

Objects are at the core of python and each object has a type. Types can either be scalar or non-scalar this means that some types such as scalar objects are indivisble. Non-scalar types such as strings have an internal structure than can be manipulated

Python has four types of scalar objects = int, float, bool, None

i // j "//" is used for integer division in python
